      <p>i’m not scared of it, but the thought that, everything you’ll ever amount to in life will be worth absolutely nothing when you die, is too overpowering. </p>
      <p>death is supposed to be the reason to live, the motive to keep going and make the most out of your life, but all the time it feels like a constant reminder that once you die, you’re dead. all the memories you made, all the accomplishments you’ve achieved, gone, like that. why make those memories and achieve those accomplishments if death will abolish them? </p>
      <p>immortality could solve this problem, but, as stated, death plays the role as a motive for you to live and cherish every moment like it’s your last, and immortality takes that aspect away, essentially making everything more meaningless than if you were to just enjoy life as it is and die as a mortal.</p>
      <p>best solution is to not be born at all ;) </p>
