      <p>Ive seen some people struggle so i'd thought share some tips on taking care of flags.</p>
      <h2>General Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>do not let the flag touch the ground. this is seen as highly disrespectful towards the country.</li>
        <li>some flags have rules around whether youre allowed to iron/wash them. please do your research on flag code if you are unsure whether you can iron/wash your flag/s. (ironing/washing list WIP)</li>
        <li>dust your indoor flags often. this can help to increase its lifetime.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>CLEAN YOUR FLAG!!</h2>
      <p>dust can get intertwined within the fibres of your flag and cause it to weaken and loose its colour.</p>
      <p>use a soft duster and dust your flag every week, or wash your flag every month.</p>
      <p>before washing a flag, use a wet tissue/cotton swab and wipe the very edges of your flag. if the colour transfers onto the swab, washing that flag isnt a good idea as the colour may run while washing it. youd be better off buying a new flag from a different brand.</p>
      <h3>machine washing a flag</h3>
      <p>to machine wash a flag, use a light/weak detergent with cold water for 15 minutes. set the spin cycle as low as you can to avoid getting tears in your flag. once the washing machine has finished, immediately take the flag out and hang it up to dry.</p>
      <h3>hand washing a flag</h3>
      <p>to hand wash a flag, again, use a light/weak detergent with cold water and use a non-harsh towel to gently scrub it. hang it up to dry.</p>
      
      <h2>Ironing your flags</h2>
      <p>alot of folks ive seen have been scared to iron their flags out of fear that theyd ruin them.</p>
      <h3>synthetics; nylon</h3>
      <p>to iron nylon/synthetic flags, lower your iron to the lowest setting and make sure its on dry. this way, the flag wont warp. if your iron is still to hot, put a cloth or towel between the iron and the flag. slowly iron the flag, while making sure not to keep the iron idle in one spot for too long as that can cause the fabric to warp too.</p>
