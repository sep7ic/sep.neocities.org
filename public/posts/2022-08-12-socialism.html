        <h2>socialism (pros/cons)</h2>
        <a href="https://environmental-conscience.com/socialism-pros-cons/">source 1</a> <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/147271/economics/pros-and-cons-of-socialism/">source 2</a>
        <p>Socialism is a political system in which the government controls all important production and distribution processes and the general public relies on the state for the supply with those important goods and services for their daily life. Socialism aims for public rather than for private ownership.</p>
        <p>Socialism is an economic system borne out of opposition to capitalism where the ‘means of production’ are collectively owned and shared. It prioritises production for use rather than profit and achieves this through centralised planning – like a government.</p>
        <p>The value of whatever is produced is determined by the amount of time and labour required, not market supply and demand. Socialism claims sharing resources and work according to need, rather than competition, creates a more equitable and secure society.</p>
        <h3>pros</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Equality for all</li>
          <li>Reduction of poverty</li>
          <li>Closing the gap between the rich and poor</li>
          <li>Money is used where its needed the most</li>
          <li>Promotion of minimum wages</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>cons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Higher tax reduces incentives to invest and work</li>
          <li>prone to government failure</li>
          <li>Powerful unions can cause labour market antagonism</li>
          <li>slow economic growth</li>

        <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-internationalbusiness/chapter/reading-the-disadvantages-of-communism/">source 1</a> <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-internationalbusiness/chapter/reading-the-benefits-of-communism/">source 2</a> <a href="https://environmental-conscience.com/communism-pros-cons/">source 3</a>
        <p>Communism is a political ideology that is still present in a few countries across the globe, the most prominent one being China.</p>
        <p>In contrast to capitalism, communism is a political system in which all production is communally-owned and private property is almost non-existent.</p>
        <p>In fact, communism can be regarded as a more extreme form of socialism.</p>
        <p>Communism is a utopian political economic system where a society is reorganised without hierarchy, states, money or class. The ‘means of production’ are shared communally and private property is non-existent or severely restricted. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the seminal political pamphlet on this, A Communist Manifesto in 1848.</p>
        <h3>pros</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Everyone is equal</li>
          <li>Every citizen can keep a job</li>
          <li>Internally stable economic system</li>
          <li>No economic classes</li>
          <li>The government owns all the businesses and properties</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>cons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The government owns all the businesses and properties</li>
          <li>no freedom of culture and speech</li>
          <li>Large or geographically-broad populations tend to be diverse, making it difficult to maintain a common goal or set of rules for shared effort andresources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>capitalism (pros/cons)</h2>
        <a href="https://environmental-conscience.com/capitalism-pros-cons/">source 1</a>
        <p>Capitalism is an economic concept where means of production are in private hands and so is the profit of these operations.</p>
        <p>In capitalist countries, contrary to socialism and communism, people are actually allowed to accumulate high levels of wealth.</p>
        <p>Capitalism is an economic system where the ‘means of production’ and resulting capital are owned by private individuals and businesses. It is based on voluntary relationships of supply and demand instead of centralised (usually government) planning. </p>
        <p>This system is rooted in classical liberal philosophy and its conception of the rational, freethinking, autonomous individual. It claims market competition forces people to act in a way that benefits others, regardless of their intention.</p>
        <h3>pros</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Gives people an incentive to work hard</li>
          <li>Better quality of products</li>
          <li>Bigger variety of products</li>
          <li>offers social and financial freedom</li>
          <li>It facilitates rapid economic growth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>cons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Can lead to excessive focus on consumption</li>
          <li>Workers get exploited</li>
          <li>Higher property prices</li>
          <li>Can lead to private monopolies</li>

        <h2>what do communists believe?</h2>
        <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/communism">source 1</a> <a href="https://qz.com/965740/why-im-a-communist-and-why-you-should-be-too/">source 2</a> <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-internationalbusiness/chapter/reading-the-benefits-of-communism/">source 3</a>
        <p>A communist seeks conditions to end the state entirely and have all human society collectively managed.</p>
        <p>Communists believe oppression is the result of our “mode of production,” which is the way we organise our means for survival. Currently, that system is capitalism.</p>
        <p>A communist wants more. A communist seeks the abolition of property, whether held by the state or private firms and citizens; they want all of us to own everything equally and become our own dictators. A communist seeks conditions to end the state entirely and have all human society collectively managed.</p>
        <p>Communism is a form of government most closely associated with the ideas of Karl Marx, which he outlined in The Communist Manifesto. Communism is based on the goal of eliminating socioeconomic class struggles by creating a classless society in which everyone shares the benefits of labour and the state controls all property and wealth.</p>
        <p>Marx believed that capitalism, with its emphasis on profit and private ownership, led to inequality among citizens. Thus, his goal was to encourage a system that promoted a classless society in which everyone shared the benefits of labour and the state government controlled all property and wealth. No one would strive to rise above others, and people would no longer be motivated by greed. Then, communism would close the gap between rich and poor, end the exploitation of workers, and free the poor from oppression.</p>
        <p>If the government controlled the economy and the people relinquished their property to the state, no single group of people could rise above another.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, there are many benefits that can be achieved through a communist society. Communist ideology supports widespread universal social welfare. Improvements in public health and education, provision of child care, provision of state-directed social services, and provision of social benefits will, theoretically, help to raise labour productivity and advance a society in its development. Communist ideology advocates universal education with a focus on developing the proletariat with knowledge, class consciousness, and historical understanding. Communism supports the emancipation of women and the ending of their exploitation. </p>

        <h2>is the hammer and sickle symbol offensive? (this is subjective.)</h2>
        <p>Of course not. Just the opposite. </p>
        <p>The hammer and sickle symbol represents the union of industrial and farm workers, organising for their own interests against the system that exploits them, capitalism.</p>
        <p>The crimes of Stalin do not invalidate the symbol. As an absolute dictator, Stalin betrayed the principles of socialism and communism, both of which are based on the power of working people.</p>
        <p>Equating communism with Stalinism is one of the big lies of the twentieth century — a lie that, judging by some of the other comments, still persists into the twenty-first.</p>
        <p>The hammer and sickle, despite its misuse by Stalinism, is a noble symbol of freedom from oppression. </p>
        <p>Communists believe oppression is the result of our “mode of production,” which is the way we organise our means for survival. Currently, that system is capitalism.</p>
<hr>
        <h2>what does the hammer and sickle symbol represent?</h2>
        <p>Communist symbols represent COMMUNISM. The affiliation with Soviet brutality does not corrupt its symbolism - you choose to conflate the ideology of communism with one of its manifestation: the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>For instance, what if someone were to complain that your RAF symbol reminded them of Dresden, in which their innocent family were bombed and some killed? Would that make the symbol as inappropriate as the hammer & sickle?</p>
        <p>The hammer & sickle is used by other communist countries and organisations, so though its original 1917 usage stemmed from the Red Guard, it has become an umbrella symbol for Marxist(-Leninist/-Maoist) communism. It does not necessarily advocate Soviet communism.</p>
        <p>The hammer and sickle represents workers and proletariat - not Soviet crimes - Yugoslavia was a communist state that had a great living standard and no mass murders. The freedom of expression was OK and artists could get away with almost capitalist ideas. I know, cause I live in the area of ex-Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>I do agree with you somewhat, but you're not completely right. I mean the swastika is now associated almost entirely with the Nazis, the group of people who killed millions, the hammer and sickle on the other hand is associated with Communism in general, which while extreme, is still a just a political opinion, not advocation of genocide. Communism is not some huge force of evil, take Cuba for example, the people in Cuba live under a Communist regime, but have a very good quality of life. I'm not supporting Communism here, but there is a significant difference from the general political idea, and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p> In several countries in the former Eastern Bloc, there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a "totalitarian and criminal ideology" and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols such as the red star is considered a criminal offence.</p>

        <h2>How many people have died under capitalism</h2>
        <p>The typical claim is that "socialist"* regimes have killed "100 million" people. This always includes famines and other things that are blamed on socialism and its supposed inefficiency, for instance, the 36 million people that died during the Chinese famine.</p>
        <p>Well, let's see how better and how efficient capitalism is then.</p>
        <p>(*Note: To be rigorous, many would agree that calling those regimes "socialist" is not accurate. But this post is about capitalism, not socialism, so let's not get into that.)</p>
        <p>UNICEF, RESULTS, and Bread for the World estimate that 15 million people die each year from preventable poverty, of whom 11 million are children under the age of five. (source)</p>
        <p>So in 10 years, capitalism kills more children under the age of 5 than socialism did in 150 years.</p>
        <p>"But that's not capitalism's fault! That's just scarcity/underdevelopment!"</p>
        <p>So why are you blaming 36 million deaths of the Chinese famine on socialism and its inefficiency?</p>
        <p>We have enough food to feed 10 billion people. Even assuming 20% of it is lost, we could still feed the entire population of the world. But we don't, because the logistics of it is expensive and inefficient. Because developing poor countries is too expensive, and sending them food "disrupts the local markets".</p>
        <p>If these people didn't need to operate under capitalism to survive, sending them food wouldn't be an issue. If we prioritized things properly, we could develop self-sustainable agriculture projects everywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>But we don't. Because of capitalism.</p>
        <p>Or something closer to us in the west:</p>
        <p>In the US alone, 20,000 to 40,000 deaths every year because of lack of health insurance. On average, that's 300,000 over the last decade.</p>
        <p>"But who's going to pay for it?"</p>
        <p>All major developed countries on Earth offer universal healthcare. The US doesn't, and blames it on costs and making sure the "markets" are open for insurance companies, so that citizens "have options". All these claims are demonstrably false, and universal healthcare is known to be cheaper and more efficient.</p>
        <p>We could be preventing all those deaths. But we don't, because of capitalism.</p>
        <p>In the US, "approximately 245,000 deaths in the United States in the year 2000 were attributable to low levels of education, 176,000 to racial segregation, 162,000 to low social support, 133,000 to individual-level poverty, 119,000 to income inequality, and 39,000 to area-level poverty" (sources). So that's about 2 million people every 10 years in the US alone.</p>
        <p>Many of these factors are related, and they are all connected to problems with capitalism. We could offer high quality education and social support for these people. We could have programs that are more inclusive to minorities. But we don't, because that's too expensive, and that gives us a reason to not take these problems seriously.</p>
        <p>5.5 million people died in the 1876-1878 famine in India because the British performed a laissez faire experiment with grain trade.</p>
        <p>You can't NOT blame this one on capitalism and the belief in free markets as perfect systems for managing resources.</p>
        <p>10 million died in the Great Bengal famine of 1770, also because of profit-seeking British involvement.</p>
        <p>500,000 Iraqis died in the Iraq war, all because of oil and US imperialism.</p>
        <p>"But you can't blame war for resources on capitalism!"</p>
        <p>Then why does socialism gets blamed for even less involvement?</p>
        <p>Many wars were motivated by imperialism and lack of large-scale cooperation and fight for resources, and these can be partially or fully blamed on capitalism and the need for expansion and profit. Any remotely conservative estimate will already put capitalism's death toll over half a BILLION people from these wars alone.</p>
        <p>These motivations are something socialism and communism actively fight against. This is exactly the kind of problem that we are trying to solve by getting rid of capitalism.</p>
        <p>Other things:</p>
        <p>In the UK, there are 10 more empty houses than homeless families. In the US, it's almost 6 houses for every homeless person. We could give everybody a home, but we don't, because the "market is the most efficient way of allocating resources".</p>
        <p>"But we can't just give people houses! Who's going to pay for it?" "That's not fair. I'm stuck with my mortgage and a homeless dude gets a free house!?"</p>
        <p>Worldwide, 100 million people are homeless and as many as 1.6 billion lack adequate housing. We could build housing for everyone, but we don't, because who's going to pay for it? Who's going to do all the work?</p>
        <p>Because of capitalism, we find ourselves in ridiculous situations like this, and everyone thinks it's NORMAL AND OK.</p>
        <p>Capitalism discourages us from helping others because that is seen as "unfair". What's the point of having good intentions under capitalism?</p>
        <p>And this is just the things I bothered searching in 10 minutes. There are many more things I could tie to capitalism.</p>
        <p>From this alone we can already see that, even excluding the wars, capitalism has easily killed more than three times the amount that is attributed to socialism in a fifth of the time, due to the same sort of "inefficiency and incompetence" as it is attributed to socialism.</p>
        <p>Excluding the wars, a rough UNDERestimate using the above figures adjusting for global population size every 25 years, puts capitalism death toll at 400-700 million people in the last century alone.</p>
        <p>That makes capitalism AT LEAST 8 TIMES more efficient at killing people than socialist and "communist" regimes.</p>
        <p>If you OVERestimate, capitalism has killed over 1.3 BILLION people in the last 100 years, making it 19x more efficient at killing people because of inefficiency and incompetence.</p>
        <p>Now imagine including the wars.</p>
        <p>These statistics are rough and not at all rigorous, but that doesn't matter. The same criticism can be made for a lot of the statistics used against socialism and communism even as ideas, instead of specific historic attempts plagued by many other issues. But nobody who claims to be striving for accuracy makes that argument, and instead, the "100 million" figure is perfectly reasonable and undeserving of a careful, critical look.</p>
        <p>Even if I'm 80% off with all of these figures, capitalism still comes out with a worst death toll in the last century than what is attribute to socialism. You can also argue for a per capita analysis, but then you should not be talking about socialist regimes being worse than capitalism before you also do the same detailed analysis for capitalism as well, which nobody will bother doing before defending capitalism. The fact everyone simply assumes capitalism fares better shows how easy capitalism has it in the minds of people.</p>
        <p>Finally, the fact so many people look at this and simply refuse to even acknowledge capitalism is to blame for any of these deaths, not even a fraction of them, shows exactly the kind of hypocrisy and lack of perspective defenders of capitalism have, and the immense lack of accountability of capitalism.</p>
        <p>And if after looking at all of this the best counterargument you have for this criticism of capitalism is defending the "100 million" figure against socialism, then you are completely oblivious to that lack of accountability.</p>
        <p>Capitalism forces us to look at these problems and accept them as part of life. Capitalism makes no attempt to address these issues, so it gets a pass for them. It's a horrifying ethical relativism that would not be tolerated in any other circumstance. Can responsibility only exist with intent? The ethical foundations of most cultures and legal systems in our society disagree. People generally agree that negligence is not an acceptable excuse.</p>
        <p>But capitalism gets a pass.</p>
        <p>It feels like just because it's not someone pointing a gun at another person, and you have access to 20 types of cereal and an iPhone, Capitalism gets a pass on all this crap.</p>
        <p>But misery, hunger, suffering and death are still there, and are just as real. They just drag for longer to the point we all get used to it. Suffering is not just a statistic, these are actual human beings suffering because of the social and economic structures we created in our world. It's all just a horror picture constantly playing in the background of our lives, one that most people simply get used to.</p>
        <p>And to me, that makes it worse, because in a way it's as if we're all pulling a very slow trigger, and we're supposed to be PROUD of it.</p>
        <p>And that's the real atrocity here. Capitalism turns us into monsters, and we are proud of it as a civilization.</p>
