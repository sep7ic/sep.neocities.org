        <p>Just 1 Nuclear power plant would power 1/7th of New Zealand's population; with 7-8 powering our whole entire country.
          Nuclear energy is the most sustainable energy currently discovered, with it only producing 3 tonnes of carbon per megawatt per hour, whereas hydropower produces 36 tonnes of carbon per megawatt per hour.
          90% of our country is dependent on hydropower, with there being over 100 hydro power plants in New Zealand, so making the switch would reduce carbon emission by nearly 90%.
          
          Fuel cells are renewable, which means spent nuclear fuel can be re-“fissioned” or recycled up to 5 times as it still contains 90% of it energy.
