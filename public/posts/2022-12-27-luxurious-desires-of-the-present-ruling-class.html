      <p>we're nothing but mere statistics to the ruling class. we will never be nothing more than slaves to the beast that is capitalism. we'll always be stuck playing as pawns in a game rigged to our disadvantage.</p>
      <p>you can try all you want, to optimise your chances of "escaping" but it will never be enough. the odds are not in your favour. there is no "win condition", neither is there a way to achieve victory.</p>
      <p>those that fail this contrived game are made to believe its their fault. its their fault they didnt try hard enough, ended up depressed and homeless. its their fault that our world is only optimised and built for a small portion of people.</p>
      <p>no matter how high you advance up the fictitious podium, youll always be behind another, youll always be working, pursuing money, chasing happiness in a world devoid of it.</p>
      <p>capitalism is the reason our society is falling apart. we've been lied too, taught to praise the system that brought us bread but disregard the fact it brought us inequality and division along with it.</p>
