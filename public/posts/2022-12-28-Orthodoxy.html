        <summary>What is Orthodoxy?<span class="icon">▶</span></summary>
        <p>The Eastern Orthodox Church is a Christian tradition that has its roots in the early Christian communities of the Eastern Roman Empire. It is one of the three main branches of Christianity, along with Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.</p>
        <p>The Church is characterised by its liturgical traditions, which include the use of iconography and the Divine Liturgy, as well as its adherence to the Nicene Creed and the Seven Ecumenical Councils. It is also known for its hierarchical structure, with the Patriarch of Constantinople being considered the "first among equals" among the heads of the various national Orthodox churches.</p>
        <p>The Eastern Orthodox Church has a strong emphasis on the sacraments, especially the Eucharist, and believes in the doctrine of theosis, or the idea that human beings can become deified through union with God. It also holds to the belief in the Virgin Mary as the Theotokos, or "God-bearer."</p>
        <p>The Church has a significant presence in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa, but it also has a significant number of followers in other parts of the world, including the United States. It is often referred to as the "Orthodox Church" or "Orthodoxy" to distinguish it from other Christian traditions.</p>
