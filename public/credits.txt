the pursuit of significance is but an eluding mirage; forever out of reach, taunting.

existence is a void, a hollow echo in an empty universe, where nothingness is all and the search for purpose is futile.

in the abyss of nothingness, we are but a whisper, our lives a fleeting thought in the mind of the universe.
